This document separates information explicitly reported by each paper from information that the paper does not provide. A commercial sensor box should not be assigned a material unless the publication or its cited hardware documentation identifies that material.

## Direction-A Competitor Sources Added September 2026 (full text read)

All six were read in full on 2026-09-22 (PDF/HTML; see `evidence/week-2026-09-21/day2.md`). None
predicts enclosure bias before fabrication; internal dissipation is absent from four and wall
conduction from all six. Two bibliographic corrections were made against the earlier abstract-level
scan: the direct competitor is **Bernard et al. 2019** (not "Barbaresco"), and the PurpleAir T/RH
paper is **Couzo, Valencia and Gittis 2024** (not "Cha"); Barkjohn et al. 2021 contains no own T/RH
bias measurement.

| Paper | Sensors | Reported material / geometry | Experimental contribution |

## Consolidated Existing Material Options

The following materials are explicitly present in the current literature set.

| Material or component | Reported use | Main benefit | Main limitation or concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASA, preferably white/off-white | Printed shields, frame parts, rain gauge, complete station parts | Better UV and outdoor-weather resistance than PLA; light color reduces solar heating | Higher print temperature; warping; printed fasteners and low-infill parts can still fail |
| PLA | Printed radiation shield | Low cost, accessible, easy to print | UV and thermal degradation; can become brittle outdoors |
| Unspecified 3D-printer resin / paper-described silicon case | Compact electronics housing | Insulates and protects a custom board | Exact weatherability cannot be assessed because chemistry is not reported |
| PVC pipe and fittings | Structural frame, mounting pole, shield coupling | Low cost, easy assembly, weather-resistant structure | Not a precision enclosure; joints and mounting stiffness must be checked |
| Commercial IP67 enclosure | EnviSense electronics and battery protection | Strong protection against dust and water; suitable for remote deployment | Sealed boxes can trap heat and cannot expose ambient sensors without external probes or vents |
| Commercial IP69 box | Electronics box in radiation-shield experiment | High ingress protection | Material and internal thermal behavior not reported |
| Electrical junction box | Raspberry Pi/electronics housing | Readily available, serviceable, weather protection | Material and thermal behavior not reported; internal heating possible |
| Polyurethane coating | Seal imperfections in printed rain-gauge funnel | Improves water sealing | Coating aging and optical/thermal effects need checking |
| Conformal coating | Protect exposed sensor circuit boards | Reduces moisture-related degradation | Can affect sensor response if applied over the sensing element |
| PTFE filter or opaque PTFE/plastic cover | Sensor contamination and UV protection | Hydrophobic and protective | Dust accumulation and cover aging can still bias readings |
| Silicone caulk, cable glands, sealed ports | Repairs, wiring penetrations, ingress control | Improves water resistance | Repairs may age; poor placement can trap water or block airflow |
| Reflective foil insulation | Low-cost passive shield prototypes | High albedo and low emissivity; inexpensive and easy to shape | Durability and structural rigidity may be limited |
| White corrugated plastic sheet | Folded low-cost Gill-style shield | Very low cost, lightweight, easy construction | UV life and build repeatability need verification |
| Silver-coated aluminum with black inner finish | Multilayer naturally ventilated shield | Reflects external radiation while absorbing internal reflected radiation | Oxidation/coating degradation and mixed-surface heating require testing |
| White PLA aspirated housing | Double-wall fan-aspirated shield | Easy, low-cost FDM fabrication and low solar absorption | Long-term weatherability, glue, fan, and exposed circuits limit autonomy |

## Consolidated Existing Geometry Options

| Geometry | Literature example | Intended function | Important tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Six-layer truncated-cone radiation shield | Botero-Valencia et al. | Block direct solar radiation and rain while permitting passive airflow | Performance depends on cone spacing, color, and wind |
| Naturally aspirated multi-plate radiation shield | Theisen et al. | Protect temperature/RH sensors while allowing ambient airflow | Temperature error increased during low-wind conditions |
| Actively aspirated shield | Oklahoma Mesonet reference in Theisen et al. | Maintain controlled airflow around temperature/RH sensors | Better airflow but requires fan power and maintenance |
| Sealed electronics box plus external sensor region | EnviSense and partly Theisen et al. | Separate weather-sensitive electronics from exposed sensing | External ports/probes and cable seals add complexity |
| Compact rectangular 3D-printed logger case | Tatsumi et al. | Protect and insulate an Arduino data logger | Suitable for electronics, not necessarily for ambient-air sensors |
| Integrated 3D-printed weather station | Theisen et al. | Combine wind, rain, radiation, and atmospheric sensing | More printed moving parts and connectors increase failure modes |
| Commercial outdoor air-quality box | Canary-S, AQ10x, AirSensEUR | Package PM/gas sensors, power, communication, and ambient sensors | Material and airflow path often undocumented; calibration can hide design effects |
| External-probe modular logger | EnviSense | Allow sealed electronics to use ultrasonic or submerged sensors | Best for sensors that do not need air exchange inside the electronics box |
| Reflective stacked-plate shield | Tarara and Hoheisel; Holden et al. | Low-cost passive radiation blocking with crossflow | Plate overlap and spacing outperform open or weakly perforated tubes |
| Double-wall elbow aspirated shield | Deford et al. | Block direct radiation/rain and force air past sensor | Fan improves low-wind accuracy but consumes power and adds a failure mode |
| Multilayer mixed-finish shield with eight vents | Liu et al. | Block downward/upward radiation and promote natural ventilation | Complex mixed-material assembly and coating durability |
| Bowl-cover flow-guided shield | Jin et al. | Guide passive flow through a protected central cavity | Larger and more complex than conventional plate shields |

## Recommended Material and Geometry Shortlist for the Lab

Based on the current literature, the first comparison should avoid testing too many unrelated options. A useful shortlist is:

1. **Current lab box**, unchanged, as the baseline.
2. **White ASA passive radiation shield plus sealed electronics box**, representing the most directly supported outdoor printed design.
3. **Current enclosure material painted or coated white**, if changing only solar absorptance is feasible.
4. **Sealed IP-rated electronics compartment plus externally ventilated sensor compartment**, representing the modular EnviSense-style separation of electronics and sensing.
5. **Optional active aspiration variant**, only if baseline results show strong low-wind or solar-heating bias and the power budget can support a fan.

The key geometry variables to record or control are:

- shield color and surface finish;
- number of plates or cones;
- plate/cone spacing;
- vent opening area and orientation;
- passive versus fan-driven airflow;
- sensor distance from electronics and battery;
- roof/overhang geometry;
- drain path and bottom openings;
- cable-gland and connector locations;
- enclosure volume and internal heat sources.
