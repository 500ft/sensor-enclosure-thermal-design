"""Lumped steady-state radiative self-heating bias model for the sensor-box variants.

SIMULATION OUTPUT -- NOT A MEASUREMENT. Every number this script prints is a
first-order analytical prediction, pending lab and co-location data. It is the
analytical baseline that the later conjugate-heat-transfer (CHT) FEA in
``docs/cad_fea_plan.md`` Section 3.2 will refine. It does not claim
regulatory-grade or certified performance (see ``README.md`` honesty constraints).

WHAT IT COMPUTES
----------------
The paper's central enclosure error mechanism is radiative self-heating: under a
solar load the enclosure/shield surface runs hot, the air the sensor sees runs
hot, and the temperature/relative-humidity (and gas) readings are biased. This
mechanism is *first order* and does not require FEA to bound: a lumped
steady-state energy balance on the sensor-coupled surface gives a defensible
delta-T-vs-variant estimate now.

For each variant we solve, per (wind speed, solar flux) operating point, the
steady-state surface/sensor temperature ``T_s`` from the energy balance

    Q_solar = Q_conv + Q_rad

        alpha * G * A_proj  +  Q_internal
            = h * A_conv * (T_s - T_air)
              + eps * sigma * A_rad * (T_s^4 - T_sky^4)

and report the sensor temperature rise above true ambient, ``dT = T_s - T_air``.
That delta-T is then mapped to the relative-humidity error the sensor would
report (warm air at fixed water-vapor content reads low RH).

VARIANTS (from ``docs/cad_fea_plan.md`` Section 2)
--------------------------------------------------
  V0  Baseline closed box. Sensor effectively coupled to a solar-loaded wall;
      light internal electronics/battery self-heating; modest natural
      convection. This is the "enclosure reads hot" baseline.
  V0P Painted closed-box control. V0 with only solar absorptance changed to
      match V1/V2; geometry, heat load, convection and emissivity stay fixed.
      V0P-to-V1 remains a system comparison, not an isolated shielding effect.
  V1  Passive multi-plate radiation shield (Stevenson-style). Stacked plates
      shade the sensor (large reduction in the solar flux that reaches it) and
      open inter-plate gaps boost natural convection. Two-zone layout keeps the
      electronics self-heating out of the sensor compartment.
  V2  Actively aspirated reference (optional). V1 shield plus a low-power fan
      that forces air past the sensor, raising the convection coefficient to a
      forced-convection value. Modeled as the upper-bound airflow benchmark.

All physical inputs are stated in ``ASSUMPTIONS`` below with a source/status and
are swept where uncertain. Run with ``--help`` for options.

    The long-wave term is split: a fraction ``f_sky`` of the surface radiates to
    the cold clear sky, the remainder exchanges with the surroundings (ground,
    mast, plates, internal air) at ambient temperature. This matters for the
    shield: by intentionally blocking the sky view (small ``f_sky``) the plates
    stop the sensor element from radiatively over-cooling below ambient, so the
    shielded reading converges to ~ambient rather than to an unphysical
    sub-ambient temperature. (A bare sky-facing plate with f_sky -> 1 *can*
    sit below ambient at night; here we model the daytime sensor, not a
    radiative cooler.)

    The convective sink and the (1 - f_sky) surroundings-radiation reference use
    the *local* air temperature, which for a shield is true ambient plus
    ``air_preheat_k`` (the plates warm the through-flowing air). The returned
    delta-T is still referenced to TRUE ambient, so this pre-heat shows up as
    residual shield bias -- the dominant real-world error of a passive screen at
    low wind.

    Returns T_s in degrees Celsius. Solved by bracketed bisection: the residual
    (heat in minus heat out) is strictly decreasing in T_s (both loss terms
